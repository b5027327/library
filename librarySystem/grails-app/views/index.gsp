	<p align="center">The <strong>Library Information System</strong> application has been created as part of an assignment for the module <strong>System Architectures</strong>. This module is just one of five that form the <strong>Computing</strong> course studied at <strong>Sheffield Hallam University</strong>. <strong>System Architectures</strong> is taught by <strong>Dr Tonderai Maswera</strong>. The <strong>Grails</strong> application has been created using a <strong>REST</strong>ful web interface, appropriately uses <strong>MVC</strong> (Model-View-Controller) and includes <strong>GIT</strong> as a code repository, detailing the use of branches to hold development stages. The application also demonstrates the use of access to a <strong>MySQL</strong> database. <strong>Students</strong> can be registered on the <strong>Library Information System</strong> and the <strong>Librarians</strong> can enter details of books. A login / logout facility has been set up for both the students who are registered and all librarians. The whole application has been developed on the <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> I set up.</p></br>
